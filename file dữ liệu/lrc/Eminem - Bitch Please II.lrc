[01:43.56]You're found dead in your garage with ten o'clock news coverage
[01:46.57]Gotta love it 'cause I expose the fa√ßade
[01:48.81]Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with God
[01:51.48]All jokes aside, come bounce wit' us
[01:53.75]Standin' over you with a 12 gauge about to bust
[01:56.11]It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
[01:58.83]I might leave in a bodybag, but never in cuffs
[02:01.41]So who do you trust? They just not rugged enough
[02:03.87]When things get rough, I'm in the club shootin' with Puff
[02:06.49]Bitch, please! You must have a mental disease
[02:08.79]Assume the position and get back down on your knees

[02:41.52]Gimme the mic, let me recite 'til Timothy White
[02:44.09]Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
[02:46.57]What if he's right? I'm just a criminal makin' a livin' off of the world's misery
[02:50.15]What in the world gives me the right
[02:51.64]To say what I like and walk around flippin' the bird?
[02:54.31]Livin' the urban life like a white kid from the burbs
[02:56.45]Dreamin' at night of screamin' at mom, schemin' to leave
[02:59.00]Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
[03:01.58]I just want you all to notice me, and people to see
[03:03.86]That, somewhere deep down, there's a decent human being in me
[03:06.58]It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
[03:09.04]Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
[03:11.68]So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV
[03:14.22]Or heard the CD usin' the "Fag" word so freely
[03:16.75]It's just me bein' me; here, want me to tone it down?
[03:19.36]"Suck my fuckin' dick, you faggot!" You happy now?
[03:21.62]Look at it
[03:22.25]I start some trouble everywhere that I go (that I go)
[03:24.95]Ask the bouncers in the club 'cause they know ('cause they know)
[03:27.43]I start some shit, they throw me out the back do' (the back do')
[03:29.98]Come back and shoot the club up with a .44 (a .44)
[03:31.84]And you don't really wanna fuck with me
[03:34.89]Only nigga that I trust is me
[03:37.32]Fuck around and make me bust this heat
[03:39.84](That's the devil, they always wanna dance)
[03:42.28]And you don't really wanna fuck with me
[03:44.85]Only nigga that I trust is me
