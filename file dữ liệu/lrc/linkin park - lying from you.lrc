[ti: Lying From You]
[length:02:55]

[00:23.28]When I pretend everything is what I want it to be
[00:26.66]I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see
[00:29.65]When I pretend I can forget about the criminal I am
[00:32.63]Stealing second after second just 'cause I know I can
[00:35.74]But I can't pretend this is the way it'll stay
[00:38.60]I'm just (trying to bend the truth)
[00:42.38]I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be
[00:44.84]So I'm (lying my way from)
[00:48.19]You (no, no turning back now)
[00:51.13]I want to be pushed aside, so let me go
[00:55.18](No, no turning back now)
[00:57.01]Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone
[01:01.76](No turning back now)
[01:03.25]Anywhere on my own 'cause I can see
[01:07.26](No, no turning back now)
[01:09.02]The very worst part of you is me
[01:13.05]I remember what they taught to me
[01:15.23]Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be
[01:18.23]Remember listening to all of that and this again
[01:21.14]So I pretended up a person who was fitting in
[01:24.20]And now you think this person really is me
[01:26.70]And I'm (trying to bend the truth)
[01:30.31]But the more I push, the more I'm pulling away
[01:32.72]'Cause I'm (lying my way from)
[01:36.13]You (no, no turning back now)
[01:39.09]I want to be pushed aside, so let me go
[01:43.18](No, no turning back now)
[01:45.07]Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone
[01:49.95](No turning back now)
[01:51.20]Anywhere on my own 'cause I can see
[01:55.13](No, no turning back now)
[01:57.04]The very worst part of you
[01:59.66]The very worst part of you is me
[02:03.89]This isn't what I wanted to be
[02:05.58]I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
[02:08.60]Like this
[02:09.79]This isn't what I wanted to be
[02:11.56]I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
[02:14.65]Like this
[02:15.89]This isn't what I wanted to be
[02:17.70]I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
[02:20.53]Like this
[02:21.60]This isn't what I wanted to be
[02:23.56]I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
[02:26.69]Like this
[02:27.87]You (no turning back now)
[02:30.20]I want to be pushed aside, so let me go
[02:34.04](No, no turning back now)
[02:35.90]Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone
[02:40.81](No turning back now)
[02:42.20]Anywhere on my own 'cause I can see
[02:46.01](No, no turning back now)
[02:47.92]The very worst part of you
[02:50.60]The very worst part of you is me
